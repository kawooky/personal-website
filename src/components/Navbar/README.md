A small project that I have been wanting to do for a while.

Perfect navbar is a reuseable react navbar component that is easily adjusted. It will make creating a navbar incredibly easy in future react web apps.

It has a responsive design using the burger sign when the screens width is small. When the burger sign is clicked the links have a roll down animation.
